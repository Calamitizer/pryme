# pryme

([GitHub repository](https://github.com/Calamitizer/pryme))

## Overview

Note: This module is early in development and not too much super-cool stuff is implemented. Check it out if you're curious, though. The `Decomposition` class is pretty nifty.

This is (/ will be) a Python module for various number-theoretic operations and combinatorial structures. Certain major functions are memoized to disk for efficiency. For example, output data for `decompose()` (which computes the prime factorization of its argument) is stored in `./memo/decompose.pryme`.

This module is *not* intended to be suitable or efficient for large primes (> 2^64). The focus of this module is number theory on a more mundane scale. For efficient large primality tests and factorizations, the user is directed towards such modules as `gmpy2` and `SymPy`.

## Usage Guide

`NotImplemented`

## Changelog

### v0.2 (21 March '16)
